This article is interesting because it reframes AI tools as the next big abstraction in the history of programming, similar to how compilers and higher-level languages changed what developers focused on.

I think this is very interesting because it talks about the most important problem we have to focus now that AI is turning our life and we have to be care of AI is taking away our jobs.

## Comment - Chen Liu

Maybe now it's time to learn how to program with AI instead of type out all the code by hand, just like you wouldn't need to type out all the assembly code (at least 95% of the time).

I liked how the article frames AI as something that changes the role of developers rather than eliminating it.
